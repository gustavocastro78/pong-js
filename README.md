## :clipboard: Project Description

This's a rereading for the classic arcade game "Pong", developed using Javascript Vanilla.

### How it works

Use the keys "W" and "S" to move the player one (left side), and the keys "I" and "K" to move the player two (right side).

When the "ball" crosses the player's frontier, a point will be increased to the opponent player, and the round will be restarted.

To restart the game, just press F5 button.
